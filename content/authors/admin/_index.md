I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at Cornell Sociology. I currently work on two lines of research tied together by a network/relational based approach to social processes and a commitment to issues of social justice and inequality: 1) the social determinants and dynamics of health behavior, and 2) the reception and valuation of Anglo scholarship in non-native English-speaking (NNES) academic communities. 

My research on health uses traditional as well as network-inference statistical models to examine the role of social networks in shaping short- and long-term health outcomes, and I have explored this theme in various contexts including infant care practices, adolescent mental health, and COVID-19 illness severity. My ongoing research in this direction includes two projects: The analysis of COVID-19 contact-tracing data as a research intern for the Chicago Department of Public Health, and an independent study that probes the socioeconomic and wellbeing implications of friendship stability during adolescents’ transition to adulthood.

The second stream of research will constitute my dissertation, which relates to the experience and impacts of English hegemony in academia among NNES communities. Current research on English hegemony mostly addresses the power assymetry between the Anglo core and the (semi-)periphery of non-Anglo communities. Yet my dissertation is motivated by the empirical puzzle that NNES scholars may voluntarily attach higher valence to practices and scholarship associated with the Anglo-American core. How do NNES scholars use and valuate Anglo publications in their everyday work? Do these trends vary overtime and across fields? What are the institutional and cultural processes that possibly shape NNES scholars' beliefs and practices about Anglo scholarship? Focusing on Chinese social sciences, my dissertation seeks to answer these questions by bridging theoretical insights from cultural and social theories (Bourdieu, Lamont, Gramsci and Fanon) with state-of-the-art methods (computataional, experimental, and qualitative) for empirical research.
